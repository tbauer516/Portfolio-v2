				"Hello there! My name is Tyler Bauer and I am a senior at the University of Washington studying Informatics. In case you do not know what Informatics is, here is a quick overview: Informatics is the midpoint between Computer Science, User Design and User Experience, and Business. I have the pleasure of learning about development skills including Java, Web Development and even Android. I also have the opportunity to develop my ability to design for a wide range of users and the specific needs that they have. I also have the skills to work in dispersed and non-dispersed teams to achieve project goals, as well as analyse and operate business processes along the way. My focus at the university has left me with a wide range of skills and abilities that I cannot wait to put to good use in industry.",
				"Below you will find a grid with some of the projects I have worked on, beginning with this very website that you are viewing. I designed and wrote up the code for the website myself (with the help from some libraries).",
				"Please enjoy your stay here with me, and feel free to reach out and connect with me below.",

The other big improvement is the ability for the website to be responsive to their mobile users."

					"description": "As an Easy Tech Associate, I was tasked with coming into work to an army of sick and broken computers that I needed to crank though in my measly 5-hour shifts. Specifically, I had to talk to customers bringing in their computers for repair, figure out what it was they were actually meaning when they described their problem, recommend a solution, and provide rationale as to why my solution was correct while translating it into terms that most people can relate to. After they left their computer, I had to juggle my time between sitting behind my counter and fixing said computer, walking around the floor helping people find things, recommending certain laptops and printers for people's needs, finding crazy back-assward solutions to people's unique problems, and running up to the front to backup cashier. One thing I took away from working at Staples was the skills to communicate to people. I learned very quickly how to communicate with people of all calibers when talking about technology."

I had to run two departments in opposite corners of the store by myself. I also had to cover the hunting and fishing department when needed, as well as run a backup cash register if they were swamped. If there is one thing that I can say that I learned from this job, it is that I know how to hold my own when the going gets tough, and I can always expect to come out on top."
